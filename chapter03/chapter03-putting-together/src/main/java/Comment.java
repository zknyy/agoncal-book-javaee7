    /**
     * 问题在于，在JUnit的TestCase里面如何注入:
     * If your container is using CDI (which by default it is in Java EE 7), 
     * the container must allow the injection via @Inject.
     * @Inject ValidatorFactory;
     * @Inject Validator;
     * 
     * Listing 3-26 说@Inject @USA应该注入
     *  Note  In the next chapters(C4), you will see how to integrate 
     * Bean Validation with other specifications 
     * such as JPA (you can add constraints to your entities) 
     * or JSF (you can constrain your backing beans).
